  <h1>Azure Data Platform Proof of Concept for Masco Corporation</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      As the sole consultant on this greenfield engagement, I delivered an
      end-to-end Azure data platform proof of concept (POC) that showcased ingestion,
      transformation, modeling, and visualization capabilities for Masco Corporation.

  <!-- Infrastructure Provisioning -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Infrastructure Provisioning</h2>
    <p>
      I customized and executed a Terraform script—my first client-facing IaC deployment—to stand
      up the core Azure resources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure Data Factory</li>
      <li>Azure Databricks</li>
      <li>Azure Storage Account</li>
      <li>Azure Key Vault</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Key responsibilities included naming conventions, resource grouping, and identity
      configuration (service principals, app registrations) to ensure best-practice security and
      manageability.
    </p>

  <!-- Data Modeling -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Modeling from Raw CSVs</h2>
    <p>
      The client supplied five large CSV files with identical schemas spanning different
      date ranges. My objective was to demonstrate a
      <strong>Kimball-style dimensional model</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>sales fact table</strong></li>
      <li>Dimension tables for products, customers, locations, and subsidiaries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I performed exploratory analysis to determine grain, resolve data inconsistencies
      (“Seattle, WA” vs “Seattle, Washington”), and validated assumptions through iterative
      sessions with business stakeholders.
    </p>

  <!-- External Data Integration -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Enhancements &amp; External Data Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Finishing core scope ahead of schedule, I integrated <em>daily copper prices</em> via a
      public API—critical for a manufacturer reliant on copper. A Databricks notebook ingested the
      feed into a Delta Lake table, enabling time-series joins with sales data and richer insight
      in downstream reports.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Power BI Dashboard -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Power BI Demo Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      I built a demonstration Power BI report featuring:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sales trends over time</li>
      <li>Sales by hierarchical product classification</li>
      <li>Performance comparisons between child companies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The dashboard served to illustrate platform potential; Masco stakeholders were extremely
      pleased with the technical execution and business value of the POC.
